# Food-security-in-Kenya
Food security prediction has been challenging governments and more so, now the problem 
trickles down to devolved governments as it lacks properly stimulated information that is 
necessary in making decision on efforts required for stabilizing food situation and status.
Current methods for identifying food insecurity crises are not based on statistical models and fail 
to systematically incorporate readily available data on prices, weather, and demographics. As a 
result, policymakers cannot rapidly identify food insecure populations. How can we increase 
productivity and achieve food security for what will be close to 10 billion people by 2050
in the world? A key solution will be by predicting the status of food security in households 
which will enable accurate decision making in planning for food availability, utilization and 
accessibility which will be aided by the availability of data collected through upcoming digital 
data collection platforms such as Digifarm in Kenya and Geofarmer launched in Colombia, 
Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda.

This project will be based on modellind a food security predictive model in Kenya.
