# Food-security-in-Kenya
The global agriculture, perhaps for the first time is crumbling. Kenya’s population is estimated to 
hit 65 million by the year 2030 (UNDESA 2017) and the glaring state of recurrent food shortages 
calls for long-term interventions to address the declining food production (KNBS Economic 
Survey 2017). If we need to feed 9.5 billion populations on earth by 2050, the food production 
needs to escalate 60 per cent above its present level (Acharya, Sankar 2019)
“Kenya will use science and technology to achieve inclusive agricultural growth, nutrition and 
food security in the country and must empower its farmers with the information necessary to 
increase their output per acre, reduce their unit cost of production and, therefore, significantly 
improve returns on their investment” (President Uhuru 2018). This calls for the use of 
mathematical analysis and modern technology procedures and techniques to farming as a 
significant open door for utilization of the innovation stack, for venture and for the 
acknowledgment of extra incentive inside the agri-food division (Noyes, 2014; Sunet al., 2013b; 
Yang, 2014). The adoption of analytics in agriculture has been increasing consistently; its market 
size is expected to grow from USD 585 million in 2018 to USD 1236 million by 2023, at a 
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.2%.
Kiambu has a population of 2,417,735 that’s expected to rise at a high growth rate in the next 
decade. With shocks such as climate shocks and the latest COVID-19 pandemic food production 
continues to decrease despite the plummeting food demand and unemployment rates keep rising. 
As a result food prices will rise whereas household income continues to drop limiting a 
household’s capacity to access food.
Food security prediction has been challenging governments and more so, now the problem 
trickles down to devolved governments as it lacks properly stimulated information that is 
necessary in making decision on efforts required for stabilizing food situation and status.
Current methods for identifying food insecurity crises are not based on statistical models and fail 
to systematically incorporate readily available data on prices, weather, and demographics. As a 
result, policymakers cannot rapidly identify food insecure populations. How can we increase 
productivity and achieve food security for what will be close to 10 billion people by 2050
in the world? A key solution will be by predicting the status of food security in households 
which will enable accurate decision making in planning for food availability, utilization and 
accessibility which will be aided by the availability of data collected through upcoming digital 
data collection platforms such as Digifarm in Kenya and Geofarmer launched in Colombia, 
Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda.
